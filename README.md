# Hi, I am Ananya! 👋
  
## 📖 About Me
I am a Master's in Computer Science student at Arizona State University. When I'm not coding or attempting to learn new things, you'll find me immersed in music or strumming the guitar. I can work successfully as part of a team and as a leader, keeping others motivated and aligned towards a common goal.
In terms of programming languages, I've done a lot of work in Java (including Android) and Python (especially Machine Learning), but I'll admit that I have a preference in Java. Currently, I'm working on a project as a part of the Data Visualization course to improve my skills with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using D3.js). As an ASU GHC Scholar, I attended the virtual Grace Hopper Conference 2021 and had a terrific experience! There's always something new to learn if you keep your eyes open for challenges and on a look out for opportunities!
